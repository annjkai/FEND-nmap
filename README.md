## Neighborhood Map Project Overview

The Udacity Neighborhood Map project is the final Front-end Web Development Nanodegree project. The task was to create a Neighborhood Map from scratch using React. For this purpose, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

## Third-party data

As part of the project requirements, I used the [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) as well as **insert second API here**

## To Do



## Credit

This was a very challenging project, and the help and advice of fellow Scholarship recipients was priceless. I wanted to thank by name Mariola Karpiewska, David Garrood, Alain Cadenat and Antje Lemberg.

In addition, this guide was absolutely invaluable in making the map work in React without using a package: https://www.klaasnotfound.com/2016/11/06/making-google-maps-work-with-react/
